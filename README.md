# AlexNet CNN with Tensorflow and ILSVRC2012 Data


Implementation of AlexNet with tensorflow. 


Requirements:

Tensorflow

Python3 

OpenCV

Put all the images you would like to test in the testModel folder.

Put bvlc_alexnet.npy model from [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/tf_alexnet/) into the same folder from where you place the test file.

Run the test file with "python testModel.py".
